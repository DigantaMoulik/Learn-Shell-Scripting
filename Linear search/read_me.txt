This is a program in Shell Script to search elements in an array using linear search method.

Linear search is a simple search algorithm that involves examining each element of a list one at a time, in sequence, until the desired element is found or it is determined that the element is not present in the list.

Linear search has a time complexity of O(n), which means that the time it takes to perform the search increases linearly with the size of the list. This makes it relatively inefficient for large lists, but it can be useful for small lists or lists that are not sorted.
