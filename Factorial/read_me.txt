This program finds the factorial of a number.

In mathematics, the factorial of a positive integer n, denoted by n!, is the product of all positive integers less than or equal to n. For example, the factorial of 5 is 5! = 5 x 4 x 3 x 2 x 1 = 120.

The factorial function is defined for positive integers only, and the factorial of 0 (zero) is defined as 1.

Here is the mathematical definition of the factorial function:

n! = n x (n - 1) x (n - 2) x ... x 3 x 2 x 1

For example:

5! = 5 x 4 x 3 x 2 x 1 = 120
4! = 4 x 3 x 2 x 1 = 24
3! = 3 x 2 x 1 = 6
2! = 2 x 1 = 2
1! = 1
0! = 1

You can use the factorial function to solve problems involving permutations and combinations. It is also used in calculus and other areas of mathematics.
