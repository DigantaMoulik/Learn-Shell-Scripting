This code helps to find the GCD or HCF of two numbers.

The greatest common divisor (GCD) of two numbers is the largest number that both numbers are divisible by. For example, the GCD of 12 and 16 is 4, because 4 is the largest number that both 12 and 16 are divisible by. The GCD of two numbers can be found using the Euclidean algorithm, which is an efficient method for finding the GCD of two numbers. The algorithm works as follows:

Divide the larger number by the smaller number and get the remainder.
If the remainder is 0, then the smaller number is the GCD.
If the remainder is not 0, then divide the smaller number by the remainder and repeat the process until the remainder is 0.
For example, to find the GCD of 12 and 16, we can use the following steps:

16 / 12 = 1 remainder 4
12 / 4 = 3 remainder 0
Therefore, the GCD of 12 and 16 is 4.

The GCD of two numbers is an important concept in mathematics, and it has a number of applications in computer science, such as in algorithms for finding the least common multiple (LCM) of two numbers, in cryptography, and in data compression.
